# Metria llama.cpp runtime adapter

The first Metria runtime adapter drives local llama.cpp command-line binaries
without using KV Fidelity's module-global backend dispatch.

It is intentionally narrow. The current adapter proves the runtime lifecycle and
evidence model before Metria adds more engines.

## What it supports

- local `llama-cli` text generation;
- local GGUF model paths;
- explicit `n_gpu_layers`, flash-attention, and expert `extra_args`;
- one runtime treatment: `llamacpp.kv_cache`;
- requested → resolved → observed runtime evidence;
- content hashing for llama.cpp binaries;
- exact redacted command records for invocations;
- optional decode-time `token_ids` capture when a compatible patched
  `llama-completion` binary is present;
- timeout and non-zero-exit failure reporting;
- instance-local sessions with no Metria global backend selector.

It does **not** yet provide server mode, batching/concurrency load generation,
per-token log probabilities, perplexity/KLD measurement, remote model download,
or a stable public CLI.

## Run specification

```python
from metria import RunSpec, TreatmentSpec, TreatmentType
from metria.protocols import InferenceRequest
from metria.runtimes import LlamaCppAdapter

spec = RunSpec(
    model={"path": "/models/model.gguf", "id": "org/model"},
    runtime={
        "name": "llamacpp",
        "bin_dir": "/opt/llama.cpp/build/bin",
        "n_gpu_layers": 99,
        "flash_attention": True,
    },
    scenario={"context": 8192, "max_tokens": 128},
    measurements=("text",),
    treatments=(
        TreatmentSpec(
            name="llamacpp.kv_cache",
            kind=TreatmentType.RUNTIME_FEATURE,
            config={"key_dtype": "q8_0", "value_dtype": "q4_0"},
        ),
    ),
)

adapter = LlamaCppAdapter()
environment = {"hardware_class": "local-gpu"}

support = adapter.probe(spec, environment)
if support.status != "supported":
    raise RuntimeError(support.reasons)

resolved = adapter.resolve(spec, environment)
session = adapter.launch(resolved, environment)
try:
    batch = session.infer((InferenceRequest(prompt="Explain KV caches briefly."),))
    observed = adapter.observe(session)
finally:
    session.close()
```

## KV-cache treatment

The adapter currently accepts one `runtime_feature` treatment named either
`llamacpp.kv_cache` or `kv_cache`.

Supported fields are:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `key_dtype` | llama.cpp `-ctk` value; default `f16` |
| `value_dtype` | llama.cpp `-ctv` value; default `f16` |
| `attention_rotation_k` | patched `LLAMA_ATTN_ROT_K_OVERRIDE` value |
| `attention_rotation_v` | patched `LLAMA_ATTN_ROT_V_OVERRIDE` value |
| `attention_rotation_disable` | patched `LLAMA_ATTN_ROT_DISABLE` value |

Unknown treatments and unknown fields fail explicitly. Metria does not silently
ignore a treatment it cannot prove it applied.

## Token-ID capture

`CaptureRequest(kind="token_ids")` selects `llama-completion` and uses the
existing `KV_FIDELITY_TRAJECTORY` patch ABI. Merely finding that binary is
recorded as `binary_present_unverified`; a run only records token capture as
observed when token records are actually returned.

This keeps the existing research instrumentation usable without making that
patch part of Metria's stable runtime contract.

## Evidence and privacy

The resolved runtime record includes the content hash of each llama.cpp binary
and file metadata for the model. Large model files are not automatically hashed
by this adapter; stronger model-artifact verification belongs in Metria's future
artifact resolver.

For each invocation, Metria records the actual managed command flags and managed
environment overrides. Prompt and system-message contents are replaced with
`<redacted>` in command evidence and represented by SHA-256 fingerprints.

`extra_args` is available for expert llama.cpp options, but cannot override
flags that Metria manages directly. This prevents the recorded resolved state
from disagreeing with the effective command line.

# Metria vLLM runtime adapter

Metria's vLLM adapter provides an optional, in-process offline inference runtime
for the shared `RuntimeAdapter` / `RuntimeSession` contracts.

The adapter is intentionally instance-scoped. It does not reuse KV Fidelity's
module-global vLLM model cache: each `VLLMSession` owns the `vllm.LLM` instance
created for one resolved run configuration.

## Optional dependency

vLLM is not a root Metria dependency and is imported only when a vLLM session
is launched. Keep vLLM in a runtime-specific environment rather than forcing it
into environments used for llama.cpp, MLX, or other engines.

`probe()` reports the run unsupported when the optional `vllm` distribution is
not importable.

## Run specification

A minimal run looks like:

```python
from metria import RunSpec, TreatmentSpec, TreatmentType

spec = RunSpec(
    model={"id": "org/model", "revision": "commit-or-tag"},
    runtime={
        "name": "vllm",
        "dtype": "bfloat16",
        "gpu_memory_utilization": 0.85,
        "max_num_seqs": 32,
        "tensor_parallel_size": 1,
        "enable_prefix_caching": False,
    },
    scenario={"context": 4096, "max_tokens": 128},
    measurements=("kv_fidelity.decode_time_trajectory",),
    treatments=(
        TreatmentSpec(
            name="vllm.kv_cache",
            kind=TreatmentType.RUNTIME_FEATURE,
            config={"dtype": "auto"},
        ),
    ),
)
```

The initial adapter deliberately owns a small runtime surface. Unknown runtime
or generation fields fail rather than being silently ignored.

## KV-cache treatment

The vLLM adapter uses a vLLM-native KV-cache treatment:

```text
vllm.kv_cache
  dtype = auto | fp8 | fp8_e4m3 | fp8_e5m2
```

Metria does not translate llama.cpp-specific `q8_0`, `q4_0`, or asymmetric K/V
formats into vLLM formats and call them equivalent. A cross-runtime study must
state the actual treatment each runtime received.

## Generation and capture

The initial semantic generation surface supports:

- `max_tokens`
- `seed`
- `temperature`
- `chat_template`
- `system`

The session batches all requests into one `LLM.generate()` call and can return
native output token IDs through:

```python
CaptureRequest(kind="token_ids")
```

This is enough for the same `TokenTrajectoryProtocol` used with llama.cpp.

Raw prompt and system text are not retained in invocation evidence. Metria
stores SHA-256 fingerprints for the original prompt, rendered prompt, and system
message along with non-sensitive generation settings and output token counts.

## Requested, resolved, and observed state

The adapter keeps configured and applied state separate.

`resolve()` records:

- model identifier/path and requested revisions;
- installed vLLM version;
- exact runtime settings passed to `LLM`;
- native KV-cache dtype;
- resolved maximum model length.

After launch, the session introspects model, cache, and parallel configuration
fields exposed by the created vLLM engine. `observe()` reports that evidence as:

```text
configured: ...
applied:
  status: introspected | unverified
  fields: ...
```

If a field cannot be recovered from the live engine, Metria does not copy the
configured value into the applied section and pretend it was verified.

## Cleanup

The adapter releases its session-owned vLLM and tokenizer references at close.
It calls a public `shutdown()` only if the installed runtime exposes one. The
cleanup record distinguishes explicit shutdown from ordinary Python reference
release; Metria does not claim that reference release proves complete device
allocator teardown.

## Cross-runtime trajectory studies

With this adapter and the llama.cpp adapter, the same trajectory measurement can
now be executed independently on two different runtimes:

```text
RunSpec -> llama.cpp -> TokenTrajectoryProtocol -> RunRecord
RunSpec -> vLLM      -> TokenTrajectoryProtocol -> RunRecord

RunRecord evidence pair -> compare_trajectory_results()
```

This is the first concrete exercise of Metria's target architecture: runtime
execution differs, while the measurement semantics and pairwise comparison
method stay fixed.

## Current limitations

The initial vLLM adapter does not yet provide:

- online/server-mode load generation;
- log-probability or KLD capture;
- concurrency/throughput benchmarking;
- runtime-level retries or worker restart policy;
- automatic treatment equivalence across engines;
- a universal dependency environment.

Those should be added as explicit protocols/capabilities rather than folded into
the basic offline trajectory path.

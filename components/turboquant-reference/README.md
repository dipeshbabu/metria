# TurboQuant Reference

`turboquant-reference` is the NumPy/SciPy reference implementation of
TurboQuant KV-cache compression in the Metria repository. The distribution
name is `turboquant-reference`; the stable Python import remains `turboquant`.

This component is intended for algorithm inspection, reproducibility, and
experimentation. Production inference integrations live in their respective
engine projects.

Its lifecycle is **source-only research software**. Local wheel/source builds
remain supported, but Metria does not publish this component to a package index.
Pin a full repository commit when depending on it or citing its behavior.

## Install

Install an immutable source snapshot, for example:

```bash
python -m pip install "turboquant-reference @ git+https://github.com/dipeshbabu/metria.git@b536a6995e78b72e68e35ad002ace2135e9e725e#subdirectory=components/turboquant-reference"
```

The commit above is a known source snapshot. Select and record the reviewed full
commit you intend to use; a mutable `main` branch is not a reproducibility pin.
For a checked-out revision, install from the repository root:

```bash
python -m pip install "./components/turboquant-reference"
```

For development, install the component in editable mode:

```bash
python -m pip install -e "./components/turboquant-reference[dev]"
```

Use the editable benchmark extra when changing real-model experiments:

```bash
python -m pip install -e "./components/turboquant-reference[bench]"
```

The benchmark extra uses PyTorch and Transformers without Accelerate. Real-model
examples load into host memory and then move to their selected device; the model
must fit host memory and that device. Automatic dispatch and offload are not
supported by these examples. When updating an existing benchmark environment,
`uv sync --all-packages --extra bench` removes the now-unused Accelerate package;
pip users can uninstall it if no other installed project requires it.

## Verify

```bash
python -m pytest components/turboquant-reference/tests -q
python components/turboquant-reference/benchmarks/examples/demo.py
```

## Public API

The package exports `PolarQuant`, `QJL`, `TurboQuant`, `TurboQuantMSE`,
`CompressedVector`, and `KVCacheCompressor`. `QJL` and the full
`TurboQuant` pipeline are retained for paper-oriented reproduction;
`TurboQuantMSE` provides the direct reconstruction-oriented path used by most
of the component experiments.

Quantizers accept finite real vectors shaped `(d,)` or `(batch, d)` and compute
in float64. Dimensions must be positive integers and seeds nonnegative integers
(NumPy integer scalars are accepted); booleans are not counts. PolarQuant/MSE and scalar codebooks support
1–8 bits, and full TurboQuant supports 2–9 total bits including QJL. Outlier
precision must be finite and within 2–9 bits.

Invalid types or dtypes raise `TypeError`; invalid values, shapes, or
unrepresentable numeric results raise `ValueError`. QJL's orthogonality invariant
raises an explicit `RuntimeError`. These checks remain active under `python -O`.
Reconstruction requires valid indices/signs and matching nonnegative norms.
Packed payloads require uint8 buffers, float32 norms, and consistent shape/bit
metadata; values outside the packed norm range are rejected.

Packing utilities support empty vectors and batches. Memory reports containing a
compression ratio require positive vector counts and dimensions. Their estimates
include norm storage; `compressed_size_bits` and quantizer compression ratios
describe the theoretical bit layout before byte padding. Use a packed payload's
`nbytes`, `memory_footprint_bytes`, or `KVCacheCompressor.memory_stats` for byte
accounting. Outlier ratios count only the norms of active channel groups.

## Layout

```text
src/turboquant/       Python reference package
tests/                Component unit tests
benchmarks/examples/  Small runnable demonstrations
benchmarks/runners/   Server and llama.cpp benchmark drivers
benchmarks/validation Real-model and dimension-scale validation
benchmarks/experiments Exploratory compression experiments
benchmarks/archive/   Historical comparisons and result snapshots
```

Run benchmark files from an environment where this component has been
installed. They intentionally import `turboquant` from the installed package
instead of modifying `sys.path`.

## Stability and compatibility

The component is an alpha research reference with its own source version.
The local distribution/import identities remain `turboquant-reference` and
`turboquant`; they are independent of root Metria and KV Fidelity. Record the
repository commit as well as the component version. Compatibility changes and
deprecations receive a changelog entry and migration guidance when practical.

Source and locally built wheels support Python 3.10 through 3.14 where
NumPy and SciPy satisfy the declared dependencies. The implementation is
portable Python, but that does not imply support for any particular production
inference engine or accelerator kernel.

See the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for user-visible changes and the
[source lifecycle](../../docs/guides/turboquant-reference-lifecycle.md) for
reproducible installation and validation. There is no package-index publishing
workflow or release-tag contract for this source-only component.

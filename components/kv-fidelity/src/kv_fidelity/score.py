"""KV Fidelity v0.1 composite scoring.

Combines per-axis scores into a single 0–100 number using the harmonic mean,
which penalises a single bad axis more aggressively than the arithmetic mean
(matches the "fail-loud" intent of the design).

Bands (tunable; align these with the paper's findings as we collect more data):

    [90, 100]  EXCELLENT — within reference noise / true equivalence
    [80,  90)  PASS      — minor drift, safe to deploy
    [60,  80)  DEGRADED  — visible drift, audit before use
    [ 0,  60)  FAIL      — flag and treat as broken

Floor verification:
    KV Fidelity(fp16-KV, fp16-KV) must be >= MIN_FLOOR (default 99.5).
    If it is not, the reference itself is non-deterministic on this build
    and KLD deltas cannot be trusted.

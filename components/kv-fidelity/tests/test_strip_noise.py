"""v0.1.3 regression tests for runner._strip_noise.

These tests pin the noise-stripper behaviour so the v0.1.1 banner-comparing
bug (where _strip_noise returned llama-cli's help banner instead of the
generation body) cannot return.

Each test feeds a canned llama-cli stdout string and asserts what survives
the noise filter.

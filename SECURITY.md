# Security Policy

## Supported versions

Security fixes are applied to the current minor release line and the default
branch. Older release lines may be asked to upgrade before receiving a fix.

| Component | Supported versions |
| --- | --- |
| `kv-fidelity` | `main` (no PyPI release yet) |
| `turboquant-reference` | `0.1.x` and `main` |

## Reporting a vulnerability

Report suspected vulnerabilities through [GitHub private vulnerability
reporting](https://github.com/dipeshbabu/efficient-llm-systems/security/advisories/new).
Do not include exploit details, secrets, or other sensitive information in a
public issue.

Include the affected component and version, the impact, reproduction steps,
and any suggested mitigation. You should receive an acknowledgement within
three business days and a status update within seven business days. Complex
reports may take longer to investigate, but updates will continue until the
report is resolved or closed.

Please allow time for a fix and coordinated release before public disclosure.
Good-faith research that avoids privacy violations, data destruction, service
disruption, and unauthorized access is welcome.

## Security scope

Reports about package integrity, unsafe handling of untrusted input, dependency
or workflow compromise, and release-pipeline vulnerabilities are in scope.
General feature requests and unsupported third-party inference engines should
use the public issue tracker instead.

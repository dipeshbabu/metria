# Efficient LLM Systems

Research, reference implementations, evaluation tools, and reproducible
evidence for making large-language-model inference more efficient without
losing behavioral fidelity.

This repository is an umbrella for work on KV-cache and weight compression,
quantization, sparse and long-context attention, inference kernels, hardware
diagnostics, cross-engine validation, and deployment-quality evaluation.
Production engine integrations live in their respective upstream projects;
this repository keeps the portable Python components, experimental tools,
current guidance, and the evidence behind the recommendations.

## Choose your path

The repository root is not a Python distribution. Do not run
`pip install efficient-llm-systems`; choose the component or workflow that
matches your goal. Commands below assume a cloned repository and run from its
root unless the linked guide says otherwise.

- **Evaluate a KV-cache configuration** — inference engineers can install the
  KV Fidelity beta CLI with
  `python -m pip install "./components/kv-fidelity"`, then verify the command
  with `kv-fidelity --help`. The real workflow produces JSON and self-contained
  HTML fidelity reports. Continue with the
  [KV Fidelity quick start](components/kv-fidelity/QUICKSTART.md) to select a backend,
  run `selftest`, and score a model.
- **Experiment with TurboQuant algorithms** — researchers can install the
  alpha reference library with
  `python -m pip install "./components/turboquant-reference"`, then run
  `python components/turboquant-reference/benchmarks/examples/demo.py`.
  The demo prints reconstruction, compression, and inner-product metrics. See
  the [TurboQuant Reference README](components/turboquant-reference/README.md)
  for the public Python API and benchmark extras.
- **Diagnose or benchmark an engine build** — systems and kernel developers can
  start with `python tools/diagnostics/turbo_hardware_diag.py --help`. Full
  runs produce a shareable diagnostic archive containing text, JSON, and CSV
  evidence. These tools have mixed stability and external engine/hardware
  requirements; follow the [tools guide](tools/README.md) before a long run.
- **Integrate TurboQuant into production** — application developers should use
  a supported inference-engine integration. This monorepo does not install
  production kernels or expose a drop-in serving runtime. Start with the
  [production ecosystem](#production-ecosystem) and the selected engine's
  documentation.
- **Contribute to the monorepo** — contributors can run `uv sync --all-packages`
  followed by `uv run pytest`. The expected output is a synchronized workspace
  and passing component tests. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the
  complete validation and evidence requirements.

The repository name is the umbrella identity. Current component contracts are:

- KV Fidelity distribution: `kv-fidelity` (not yet released on PyPI)
- KV Fidelity import: `kv_fidelity`
- KV Fidelity command: `kv-fidelity`
- TurboQuant reference distribution: `turboquant-reference`
- TurboQuant reference import: `turboquant`

- [TurboQuant configuration recommendations](docs/guides/turboquant-recommendations.md)
- [Benchmark reference](docs/reference/benchmarks.md)

## Development setup

Install `uv`, then synchronize the workspace from the repository root:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dipeshbabu/efficient-llm-systems.git
cd efficient-llm-systems

uv sync --all-packages
uv run pre-commit install
uv run pytest
```

Backend-specific KV Fidelity dependencies are optional. Add only the extra needed
for the backend under test:

```bash
uv sync --all-packages --extra mlx
uv sync --all-packages --extra sglang
```

Avoid `--all-extras`: the backend stacks have different platform and hardware
requirements. The vLLM adapter remains in the source tree, but its managed
extra is temporarily unavailable: the latest published vLLM release pins
PyTorch 2.11.0, which is affected by
[GHSA-rrmf-rvhw-rf47](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rrmf-rvhw-rf47).
Do not override that pin; use an existing audited environment or another
backend until vLLM publishes support for PyTorch 2.13 or newer.

Python code follows PEP 8. Ruff enforces linting and import order and formats
the codebase using the repository's Python 3.10 target and 88 character line
length. Line-length rule `E501` is delegated to the formatter. Pre-commit runs
Ruff, mypy, and the repository's lightweight file checks before each commit.
See the [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for check and fix commands.

## Current findings

The repository's controlled experiments support three recurring conclusions
within the tested model and hardware matrix:

1. Value-cache compression can often be substantially more aggressive than
   key-cache compression. See the
   [asymmetric K/V study](research/papers/asymmetric-kv-compression.md).
2. Key precision usually dominates quality because K controls attention
   routing. See the
   [M5 Max stress test](research/papers/m5-max-stress-test.md).
3. Boundary layers are disproportionately sensitive on several tested
   architectures. See the
   [layer-aware V study](research/papers/layer-aware-v-compression.md).

These are evidence-bounded findings, not universal guarantees. Validate every
new model, engine, context length, and hardware target. KV Fidelity exists to make
that comparison behavioral rather than relying on perplexity alone.

## Production ecosystem

The production implementations are maintained outside this research
monorepo:

| Project | Role |
|---|---|
| [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) | Upstream TurboQuant attention backend |
| [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) | Upstream Hadamard KV rotation and platform kernels |
| [Historical llama.cpp TurboQuant fork](docs/reference/historical-forks.md#llamacpp-experimental-forks) | Full TurboQuant KV and weight formats across Metal, CUDA, HIP, and CPU; public fork URL currently unavailable |
| [mlx-swift-lm](https://github.com/ekryski/mlx-swift-lm) | Apple Silicon inference and TurboQuant collaboration |
| [Historical vllm-swift prototype](docs/reference/historical-forks.md#swift-and-long-context-prototypes) | Swift serving on Apple Silicon; public prototype URL currently unavailable |

Use the component and engine documentation for supported formats and current
runtime flags.

Current guidance belongs in `docs/`. Dated claims and negative results belong
in `research/`. Generated evidence belongs in `artifacts/`. Executable
workflows belong in `tools/` or the component that owns them.

## Verification

Run the complete Python gate:

```bash
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
uv run pytest
```

Build components independently:

```bash
uv run python -m build components/kv-fidelity
uv run python -m build components/turboquant-reference
```

The root is deliberately not a publishable Python distribution. Each
component owns its dependencies, tests, package data, and release lifecycle.

## Citing this work

repository as a whole supports your work. When relying on a result or claim
from `research/`, also cite the specific report so readers can recover its
model, engine, hardware, configuration, and date.

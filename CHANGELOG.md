# Metria changelog

This changelog covers the root `metria` distribution. KV Fidelity and
TurboQuant reference packages have independent versions and release notes.

## Unreleased

- Added copyable verification workflows with synthetic PASS/FAIL/invalid-comparison
  fixtures, qualified local configuration instructions, and explicitly staged
  runtime/KV/quantization/build templates with readiness checks.

- Added a pinned real vLLM qualification tool and controlled manual workflow.
  Official backend wheel build labels are retained separately from loaded module
  public versions; contradictory public versions or build labels still fail.

- Added verifier-native cold-process request-latency impact with explicit source,
  workload, warmup/trial and aggregation identity. Deltas require valid comparison
  and compatible methods; unsupported streaming/memory metrics remain unavailable.

- Removed contributor-local home paths from archived logs and paper references,
  retained original/redacted hashes in shared manifests, and added a portable-path
  gate plus an evidence/source mapping without changing historical results.

- Assigned distinct verification exits for policy failure, invalid inputs,
  non-comparable runs, insufficient evidence, and execution/preflight failure.
  Added redacted machine-readable input errors and a GitHub Actions summary and
  artifact example. CI integrations that matched only exit 1 must accept every
  nonzero exit as failure.

- Added versioned serialization for the shared `ArtifactManifest` and enforced
  license-file and provenance checks for explicitly designated headline artifacts.
  Third-party and generated-material rights remain explicit, including unknowns.

- Added canonical `verification.json` output and deterministic Markdown reports
  with separate lifecycle, comparison, and policy states. The original manifest
  filename remains a compatibility alias; incomplete evidence cannot appear as
  a valid comparison in the summary.

- Added versioned trajectory divergence diagnostics with sample counts, category
  rates, first-divergence distributions, deterministic prompt ranking, and length
  mismatches. Policies can bound `behavior.divergence_rate`; missing captures do
  not produce a zero-divergence claim.

- Added optional, versioned verification policies with typed numeric bounds and
  exact boolean/status checks. Policies are included in recipe identity and
  produce PASS/FAIL only after verifier correctness gates succeed. Missing or
  method-incompatible evidence remains insufficient; no default thresholds are
  supplied. Reports retain each criterion, value, identity, and outcome.

- Moved TurboQuant KV support policy into an explicit integration, with generic
  capability-check registration shared by inspection, execution, and verification.
  Built-in preflight protections and experimental override evidence are preserved.

- Added a shared subprocess runner with wall-clock deadlines, process-tree
  cleanup, bounded partial output, and command fingerprints. Hardware diagnostic
  runs now time out even when a child is silent or never emits a newline.

- Added shared, bounded SHA-256 artifact resolution and allowlisted ZIP
  extraction with reusable provenance manifests. KV Fidelity now consumes this
  API for its pinned WikiText-2 cache. Root development is `0.1.1.dev0`.

- Runtime identity mapping reads reuse deeply immutable evidence instead of
  rebuilding it for every field lookup, iteration, or length query.

## 0.1.0

First Alpha release, published on 2026-09-10.

### Local llama.cpp verification

- `metria verify` compares two CPU thread counts using the same pinned GGUF,
  qualified llama.cpp binary, greedy completion workload, and batch settings.
- Native readback checks what actually ran before token trajectories are
  compared. Missing or inconsistent evidence cannot produce a verified result.
- Each execution retains a manifest, readable report, and both run records.
  Failures, timeouts, interruption, and partial evidence remain inspectable.
- Source archives include the pinned CPU runtime build helper, capture patch
  and its upstream MIT license, and model/recipe preparation tools.

### Evidence APIs and supporting commands

- Immutable study, run, model, runtime, workload, and hardware identities.
- Failure-aware Python execution APIs with llama.cpp and vLLM adapters.
- Versioned JSON recipes and run records with deterministic SHA-256 digests.
- Recipe validation, normalization and digesting; capability inspection;
  saved-record comparison; and token-trajectory agreement analysis.
- A dependency-free Python wheel and source distribution for Python 3.10–3.14.
  Inference runtimes and models are installed separately.

### Scope and qualification

The end-to-end CLI is qualified on Linux/Ubuntu WSL with local CPU inference.
Core tests also run on Windows and macOS. GPU settings, quantization treatments,
runtime upgrades, chat templates, and repeated-trial policies are outside the
first verifier's supported scope. The vLLM Python adapter is available but is
not an end-to-end release-qualified CLI workflow.

`VERIFIED` means the requested comparison had sufficient evidence and its
analysis completed. It does not mean task quality, speedup, or deployment
acceptance. Process timing includes startup and model loading. The retained
tiny-model example is an integration check, not a performance or quality study.

Prompt and generated text are omitted from summary reports. Run records retain
requested configuration, which can include prompts and local paths; review them
before sharing. Public APIs remain provisional during the 0.1 series.

See the [verification guide](docs/guides/metria-verify.md) for installation,
exit codes, evidence interpretation, and setup requirements.
